{"question":"<p>The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the $7$<sup>th</sup> triangle number would be $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28$. The first ten terms would be:\n$$1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, \\dots$$</p>\n<p>Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:</p>\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf 1 &amp;\\colon 1\\\\\n\\mathbf 3 &amp;\\colon 1,3\\\\\n\\mathbf 6 &amp;\\colon 1,2,3,6\\\\\n\\mathbf{10} &amp;\\colon 1,2,5,10\\\\\n\\mathbf{15} &amp;\\colon 1,3,5,15\\\\\n\\mathbf{21} &amp;\\colon 1,3,7,21\\\\\n\\mathbf{28} &amp;\\colon 1,2,4,7,14,28\n\\end{align}\n<p>We can see that $28$ is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.</p>\n<p>What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?</p>\n\n","answer":"5537376230"}
