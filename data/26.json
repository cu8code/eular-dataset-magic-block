{"question":"<p>A unit fraction contains $1$ in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators $2$ to $10$ are given:</p>\n\\begin{align}\n1/2 &amp;= 0.5\\\\\n1/3 &amp;=0.(3)\\\\\n1/4 &amp;=0.25\\\\\n1/5 &amp;= 0.2\\\\\n1/6 &amp;= 0.1(6)\\\\\n1/7 &amp;= 0.(142857)\\\\\n1/8 &amp;= 0.125\\\\\n1/9 &amp;= 0.(1)\\\\\n1/10 &amp;= 0.1\n\\end{align}\n<p>Where $0.1(6)$ means $0.166666\\cdots$, and has a $1$-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that $1/7$ has a $6$-digit recurring cycle.</p>\n<p>Find the value of $d \\lt 1000$ for which $1/d$ contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.</p>\n\n","answer":"-59231"}
