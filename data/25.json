{"question":"<p>The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:</p>\n<blockquote>$F_n = F_{n - 1} + F_{n - 2}$, where $F_1 = 1$ and $F_2 = 1$.</blockquote>\n<p>Hence the first $12$ terms will be:</p>\n\\begin{align}\nF_1 &amp;= 1\\\\\nF_2 &amp;= 1\\\\\nF_3 &amp;= 2\\\\\nF_4 &amp;= 3\\\\\nF_5 &amp;= 5\\\\\nF_6 &amp;= 8\\\\\nF_7 &amp;= 13\\\\\nF_8 &amp;= 21\\\\\nF_9 &amp;= 34\\\\\nF_{10} &amp;= 55\\\\\nF_{11} &amp;= 89\\\\\nF_{12} &amp;= 144\n\\end{align}\n<p>The $12$th term, $F_{12}$, is the first term to contain three digits.</p>\n<p>What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain $1000$ digits?</p>\n\n","answer":"983"}
