{"question":"<p>The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:none;\">\n<li>$n \\to n/2$ ($n$ is even)</li>\n<li>$n \\to 3n + 1$ ($n$ is odd)</li></ul>\n<p>Using the rule above and starting with $13$, we generate the following sequence:\n$$13 \\to 40 \\to 20 \\to 10 \\to 5 \\to 16 \\to 8 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 1.$$</p>\n<p>It can be seen that this sequence (starting at $13$ and finishing at $1$) contains $10$ terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at $1$.</p>\n<p>Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?</p>\n<p class=\"note\"><b>NOTE:</b> Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.</p>\n\n","answer":"137846528820"}
